## Postmortem: E-commerce Checkout Slowdown (1 hour)

**Issue Summary**

**Duration:**  Thursday, April 10th, 2024, 14:00 PST - 15:00 PST (1 hour)
**Impact:** Our e-commerce website experienced a significant slowdown during checkout, causing delays and frustration for users. Approximately 30% of users attempting checkout were affected.
**Root Cause:** A memory leak in our custom shopping cart application code overloaded the application server.

**Timeline**

* **14:00 PST:**  Monitoring alerts triggered due to a surge in response times for the checkout page.
* **14:05 PST:** On-call engineer investigated and confirmed slow checkout process impacting user experience. Initial suspicion was network congestion.
* **14:10 PST - 14:30 PST:** The engineering team investigated network infrastructure and CDN configuration, but no anomalies were found.
* **14:30 PST - 14:45 PST:** Investigation shifted to the application server. Logs revealed high memory usage and potential garbage collection issues.
* **14:45 PST:** The incident was escalated to the development team specializing in the shopping cart application.
* **14:50 PST - 14:55 PST:** The development team identified and patched a memory leak in the application code responsible for calculating shipping costs.
* **14:55 PST:** The application server was restarted with the patched code.
* **15:00 PST:** Monitoring confirmed normal checkout process functionality resumed.

**Root Cause and Resolution**

The root cause of the slowdown was a memory leak in the custom shopping cart application code. This leak caused the application server to progressively consume more memory over time, leading to slower processing and response times for user requests, particularly the checkout process.

The development team identified the specific code responsible for calculating shipping costs as the culprit. This code was not properly releasing memory after calculations, resulting in a continuous accumulation within the application server.  A patch was implemented to address the memory leak by ensuring proper memory management during shipping cost calculations.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures**

* **Improve code reviews:** Implement stricter code review processes to identify potential memory leaks before deployment.
* **Static code analysis tools:** Integrate static code analysis tools to automatically detect memory leaks during development.
* **Enhanced monitoring:** Refine application server monitoring to provide more granular insights into memory usage and trigger alerts for abnormal consumption patterns.
* **Load testing:**  Regularly perform load testing with a focus on simulating peak checkout traffic to identify and address potential bottlenecks before impacting production.

This incident highlights the importance of proactive memory management in web applications. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined above, we can significantly reduce the risk of future memory leaks and ensure a smooth checkout experience for our users.
